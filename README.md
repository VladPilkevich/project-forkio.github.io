  Welcome to my second web development project, completed in October 2021. This project is a pixel-perfect (px to px) layout with full responsive design for laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. The entire layout was created based on a design provided in Figma.
</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
  This was my first experience with responsive design. I focused on creating a pixel-perfect layout for multiple screen sizes, ensuring that it looks great on laptops, tablets, and phones. The design was carefully translated from Figma, keeping the exact dimensions and style as per the original design.
</p>

  <li>Pixel-perfect design, fully responsive</li>
  <li>Layouts optimized for laptops, tablets, and mobile devices</li>
  <li>First project using responsive web design techniques</li>
  <li>Design fully translated from Figma</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<h2>Responsive Design</h2>

</p>

</ul>
